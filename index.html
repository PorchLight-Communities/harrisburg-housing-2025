<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>As Harrisburg grows and plans for the future, PorchLight was contracted to assess the upcoming housing needs of the community.</p>
<p>To conduct this assessment, PorchLight analyzed existing data, conducted a visual inspection of housing structures in town, and collected input through interviews. This report analyzes the period from 2023-2033.</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Harrisburg is poised for another decade of rapid population growth that will more than double its population. Based on our demographic modeling, we expect Harrisburg’s population to increase from 9,416 in the projection’s base year of 2023 to 18,309 in 2033. Across conversations with many different stakeholders, all expect Harrisburg’s growth to continue at its current pace, driven in large part by Harrisburg’s proximity to Sioux Falls. Demands on Harrisburg’s infrastructure are not expected to prevent growth from continuing at a rapid pace.</p></li>
<li><p>The average cost (according to building permits) to build a single-family home in Harrisburg increased from $243,000 in 2021 to $397,000 in 2024, while the median cost to build such a home increased more modestly from $228,000 to $318,000 (still a significant increase). However, for multi-family units, the average construction cost per unit decreased from $150,000 in 2021 to $125,000 in 2024, with the median unit decreasing in cost from $148,000 to $105,000.</p></li>
<li><p>In total, we project demand for 5,647 owner-occupied housing units in 2033, compared to a supply of 2,606 units, resulting in a net demand for 3,041 additional owner-occupied housing units in Harrisburg in 2033 compared to 2023.</p></li>
<li><p>In total, we project a 2033 demand for 1,560 rental housing units, compared to a supply of 664 rental housing units, resulting in a net demand for 895 rental housing units in 2033 compared to 2023.</p></li>
<li><p>Harrisburg’s households are generally higher-income than the surrounding area, but its workforce needs, particularly with regard to education and service industry jobs, mean it needs housing options for a variety of income levels for robust and sustainable growth.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Based on our research and analysis, we recommend the following:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Harrisburg should develop a growth plan to prepare for extraordinary expansion from roughly 9,400 residents in 2023 to more than 18,300 by 2033.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Harrisburg should support new owner-occupied housing with 3,041 new units.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Harrisburg should expand rental housing options with 895 new units.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Harrisburg should prioritize housing affordability for key industries like education and the service sector.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Harrisburg should align its housing policy to support the financial requirements of growth.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Harrisburg should undertake proactive measures to maintain the long-term quality of its overwhelmingly new housing stock.</p>
<p>Read on through the rest of the report for our recommendations, a detailed housing needs analysis, and an appendix full of detail and additional analysis.</p>

<h1>Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis contained in this report, we recommend the following:</p>
<p><strong>1. Harrisburg should develop a growth plan to prepare for extraordinary expansion from roughly 9,400 residents in 2023 to more than 18,300 by 2033.</strong></p>
<p>Harrisburg is projected to grow from roughly 9,400 residents in 2023 to more than 18,300 by 2033, with the number of households expected to double from approximately 3,350 to nearly 7,000. This level of growth will require proactive, coordinated planning. Harrisburg should adopt a growth plan to map where future residential and commercial development should occur, including target years for infrastructure build out, modeled on the Sioux Falls growth plan. This will help coordinate infrastructure investment—roads, utilities, and water—with projected growth areas to avoid gaps or inefficient development and allow Harrisburg to engage developers early to ensure projects align with the city’s infrastructure and land use plans.</p>
<p><strong>2. Harrisburg should support new owner-occupied housing with 3,041 new units.</strong></p>
<p>Harrisburg will require approximately 3,041 new owner-occupied units by 2033, more than doubling the current stock. Single-family homes represent the vast majority of projected demand. While the greatest net need is for households earning $150,000 or more, realistically, Harrisburg has demand for housing and should expect growth across nearly all income levels. Encouraging varied housing products—such as townhomes and smaller single-family homes—could help to create attainable entry points for first-time buyers.</p>
<p>Demand for owner-occupied units in Harrisburg will primarily be for single-family homes (about 2,885 additional housing units), though based on peer area analysis there may be some demand for owner-occupied multi-family units (about 54 additional units), as well. Based on peer areas, we also anticipate some demand in the market for the owner-occupied segment typically filled by mobile homes (about 102 housing units).</p>
<p>See <a href="#owner-occupied-housing">Owner-Occupied Housing</a> for more detail.</p>
<p><strong>3. Harrisburg should expand rental housing options with 895 new units.</strong></p>
<p>Harrisburg is projected to need 895 additional rental units by 2033, more than doubling its current rental stock. This new rental supply needs to serve a variety of income bands, with particular attention to households earning below $50,000 annually, including middle- to low-income renters, such as teachers and service-industry workers. Multi-family construction will play an essential role to meet demand efficiently and provide flexible options for workers moving into the community. Harrisburg should monitor rental vacancy rates (targeting 5% vacancy) to ensure there is adequate availability for new residents without creating long-term vacancies.</p>
<p>Based on PorchLight’s modeling, the anticipated demand by type of housing for rental housing units is 194 additional single-family homes, 699 additional multi-family units, and 2 mobile homes.</p>
<p>See <a href="#rental-housing">Rental Housing</a> for more detail.</p>
<p><strong>4. Harrisburg should prioritize housing affordability for key industries like education and the service sector.</strong></p>
<p>Harrisburg’s workforce, including teachers and service-industry employees, are at risk of being priced out of living in Harrisburg, particularly for new construction. Education professionals often desire to live in the community where they work, and workers in the service industry can be stretched thin by the extra cost of long commutes. Prioritizing affordable options to attract and retain these key parts of Harrisburg’s workforce should be a priority across owner-occupied and rental housing.</p>
<p>Right now, there are 817 people employed in “educational services” who work in Harrisburg, but only 398 people employed in “educational services” live in Harrisburg. Ensuring Harrisburg educators have the opportunity to live in Harrisburg will take intentional effort.</p>
<p><strong>5. Harrisburg should align its housing policy to support the financial requirements of growth.</strong></p>
<p>Rapid growth places significant pressure on city finances, particularly with property tax changes affecting revenue opportunities through growth. Sales tax provides important, uncapped revenue for the city’s budget and Harrisburg should support sales tax growth by encouraging local commercial activity. However, low-wage workers in the service sector are particularly sensitive to the costs of commuting, so ensuring housing exists to meet these workers’ needs is critical to ensure local service industry establishments can meet their workforce needs.</p>
<p>By providing opportunities for service-sector workers to live in Harrisburg, Harrisburg can support the workforce needs of businesses that will support “quality of life” in Harrisburg and drive sales tax growth to pay for infrastructure and amenity growth for the community.</p>
<p><strong>6. Harrisburg should undertake proactive measures to maintain the long-term quality of its overwhelmingly new housing stock.</strong></p>
<p>While Harrisburg’s housing stock is overwhelmingly in sound condition, the newness of this housing stock can mask how well it is being cared for. Being proactive about code enforcement will allow Harrisburg to maintain the quality of its housing stock and ensure that these homes remain habitable for decades to come. In addition, because most of Harrisburg’s housing stock is so new, there are fewer older, naturally affordable homes and thus a need for alternative affordability strategies compared to similarly sized communities, since the community cannot rely on aging housing stock to provide low-cost options.</p>

<section id="housing-needs-analysis" class="level1">
<h1>Housing Needs Analysis</h1>
<p>To project future housing needs for Harrisburg, PorchLight analyzed available data using our custom housing model built for rural communities and small towns.</p>
<p>The owner-occupied and rental analyses each include a summary of the modeling, a high-level look at the expected change in housing units required, and a summary table showing the net change in units required by 2033 compared to 2023.</p>
<section id="owner-occupied-housing" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="owner-occupied-housing">Owner-Occupied Housing</h2>
<p>The blue “Demand Model” chart shows the modeling PorchLight conducted to estimate demand for owner-occupied housing units in 2033. We first looked at current households by income, then adjusted for anticipated changes in age cohorts and income, and finally adjusted for ideal vacancy rates.</p>
<iframe title="Owner-Occupied Demand Model" aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-r1IbV" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/r1IbV/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="822" height="207" data-external="1"></iframe>
<p>The yellow “Supply Model” chart shows the modeling PorchLight conducted to estimate supply for owner-occupied housing units in 2033. We first looked at the number of housing units in 2023 and then adjusted for how many of those housing units will be obsolete in 2033, based on the age of each unit and regional data for rural communities based on United States Department of Housing and Urban Development Components of Inventory Change (CINCH) data.</p>
<iframe title="Owner-Occupied Supply Model" aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-odQUh" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/odQUh/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="822" height="183" data-external="1"></iframe>
<p>Based on the above modeling, this table presents the net need for units to supply each income category.</p>
<iframe title="Owner-Occupied Supply vs. Demand" aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-RpoMb" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/RpoMb/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="706" height="197" data-external="1"></iframe>
<p>For income categories that have a net negative demand for units, this does not mean those units need to be demolished or taken offline. It just means that Harrisburg should account for lower demand in surrounding income categories.</p>
<p>In total, Harrisburg needs 3,041 net owner-occupied units by 2033, compared to 2023.</p>
<iframe title="Owner-Occupied Supply vs. Demand" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-vrSRs" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vrSRs/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="578" height="480" data-external="1"></iframe>
<p>The greatest net demand for owner-occupied housing in Harrisburg is for households with a household income of $150,000 or greater, with 1,227 additional units needed. While the $100,000-$150,000 income range will actually have a higher total demand for units in 2033 (1,815 units), the net demand is lower because the supply begins at a higher starting point in 2023.</p>
<p>Overall, because of its significant growth numbers, Harrisburg needs owner-occupied housing at essentially every income level, though the greatest demand for units is at the highest income levels.</p>
<p>One area where this model likely underestimates future demand is for low-income households. As Harrisburg seeks to increase amenities like restaurants and stores to serve its growing population, there will be an increased need to fill lower-wage jobs in the community. However, as Benner &amp; Karner note in the 2016 publication <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2015.1112565">“Low-wage jobs-housing fit: identifying locations of affordable housing shortages,”</a> low-wage workers are particularly sensitive to commute distances as travel costs make up a proportionally larger portion of their budget. For service-industry jobs with a low degree of variability in experience between locations (for example, working at a McDonald’s in Sioux Falls is largely the same experience as working at a McDonald’s in Harrisburg), low-wage workers are more likely to prioritize work closer to their home. If Harrisburg does not provide opportunities for lower-income households to live in the community, they will also be less likely to work in the community. Much of this need will likely be filled through rental housing, but it is worth noting here, as well.</p>
<iframe title="Harrisburg, SD Owner-Occupied Housing Unit Type Mix" aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-dGA8a" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/dGA8a/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="183" data-external="1"></iframe>
<p>Based on PorchLight’s modeling, anticipated demand by type of housing for owner-occupied housing units is 2,885 additional single-family homes, 54 additional multi-family units, and 102 mobile homes.</p>
<p>We consider a unit to be a <strong>single-family home</strong> if it is “a 1-unit structure detached from any other house, that is, with open space on all four sides. Such structures are considered detached even if they have an adjoining shed or garage. A one-family house that contains a business is considered detached as long as the building has open space on all four sides. Mobile homes to which one or more permanent rooms have been added or built also are included.” Alongside detached housing structures, attached single-family housing structures are also included in this definition, meaning “a 1-unit structure that has one or more walls extending from ground to roof separating it from adjoining structures. In row houses (sometimes called townhouses), double houses, or houses attached to nonresidential structures, each house is a separate, attached structure if the dividing or common wall goes from ground to roof.” <a href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/tech_docs/subject_definitions/2023_ACSSubjectDefinitions.pdf">(ACS Technical Documentation)</a></p>
<p><strong>Multi-family units</strong> “are units in structures containing 2 or more housing units” <a href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/tech_docs/subject_definitions/2023_ACSSubjectDefinitions.pdf">(ACS Technical Documentation)</a> where units share vertical space with other units.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile homes</strong> are a nuanced piece of this housing mix analysis. Manufactured or mobile homes can provide a quick route to generating affordable housing, but can present challenges for a community around housing upkeep, utilities management, and storm resilience. For individuals, mobile homes can present as an opportunity to build home equity while in fact being a rapidly depreciating asset with potentially unaffordable maintenance and upkeep costs.</p>
<p>However, improvements in the quality of factory-built or prefabricated housing, especially when permanently installed on a more traditional lot, may present real affordable housing opportunities with limited downsides.</p>
<p>Either way, our model indicates that Harrisburg should expect some demand from households that would traditionally be filled by mobile homes and should be proactive in efforts to meet those needs through thoughtful, intentional action.</p>
<p><strong>Calculating Owner-Occupied Housing Affordability</strong></p>
<p>Changing interest rates and household-specific down payment amounts make the home prices required for specific incomes highly variable. Because the interest rate environment over the life of this report is variable, we do not provide recommendations for specific home prices. For individuals building their own detached single-family homes, the owner-occupied market will take care of itself, as long as they can secure land and builders. However, for spec homes, townhomes, etc., builders will need to assess the financial environment and market as they prepare a specific project.</p>
<p>Use this calculator to get a sense of what these income bands translate to in terms of purchasing power.</p>

We first look at the number of housing units in 2023 and then adjust for how many of those housing units will be obsolete in 2033, based on the age of each unit and regional data for rural communities based on United States Department of Housing and Urban Development Components of Inventory Change (CINCH) data.</p>

<p>Based on the above modeling, this table presents the net need for units to supply each income category.</p>

<p>In total, Harrisburg needs 895 rental units by 2033 according to our model.</p>
<iframe title="Rental Supply vs. Demand" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-BRpZm" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BRpZm/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="578" height="480" data-external="1"></iframe>
<p>Rental demand is significantly lower than owner-occupied demand in Harrisburg. However, with 895 anticipated net units required, we expect rental housing units to more than double in 2033 compared to 2023, so Harrisburg’s rental housing needs are far from insignificant.</p>
<p>The number of net units required for rentals is fairly evenly distributed across the income spectrum, with the exceptions being lower demand for households with incomes below $15,000 and above $150,000.</p>
<p>As noted in the owner-occupied needs analysis, one area where this model likely underestimates future demand is for low-income households. As Harrisburg seeks to increase amenities like restaurants and stores to serve its growing population, there will be an increased need to fill lower-wage jobs in the community. However, as Benner &amp; Karner note in the 2016 publication <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2015.1112565">“Low-wage jobs-housing fit: identifying locations of affordable housing shortages,”</a> low-wage workers are particularly sensitive to commute distances as travel costs make up a proportionally larger portion of their budget. For service-industry jobs with a low degree of variability in experience between locations (for example, working at a McDonald’s in Sioux Falls is largely the same experience as working at a McDonald’s in Harrisburg), low-wage workers are more likely to prioritize work closer to their home. If Harrisburg does not provide opportunities for lower-income households to live in the community, they will also be less likely to work in the community. Much of this need likely needs to be filled through rental housing.</p>

<p>Based on PorchLight’s modeling, anticipated demand by type of housing for rental housing units is 194 additional single-family homes, 699 additional multi-family units, and 2 mobile homes.</p>
<p>We consider a unit to be a <strong>single-family home</strong> if it is “a 1-unit structure detached from any other house, that is, with open space on all four sides. Such structures are considered detached even if they have an adjoining shed or garage. A one-family house that contains a business is considered detached as long as the building has open space on all four sides. Mobile homes to which one or more permanent rooms have been added or built also are included.” Alongside detached housing structures, attached single-family housing structures are also included in this definition, meaning “a 1-unit structure that has one or more walls extending from ground to roof separating it from adjoining structures. In row houses (sometimes called townhouses), double houses, or houses attached to nonresidential structures, each house is a separate, attached structure if the dividing or common wall goes from ground to roof.” <a href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/tech_docs/subject_definitions/2023_ACSSubjectDefinitions.pdf">(ACS Technical Documentation)</a></p>
<p><strong>Multi-family units</strong> “are units in structures containing 2 or more housing units” <a href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/tech_docs/subject_definitions/2023_ACSSubjectDefinitions.pdf">(ACS Technical Documentation)</a> where units share vertical space with other units.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a.-population-data-and-trends">A. Population Data and Trends</h2>
<p>To understand current population patterns in Harrisburg, PorchLight conducted a custom age-cohort analysis to identify typical inflows and outflows by age and model anticipated population growth. <a href="#k.-methodology-notes">(See Methodology)</a></p>
<iframe title="Harrisburg, SD Projected Population Growth" aria-label="Stacked Columns" id="datawrapper-chart-R047Z" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/R047Z/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="437" data-external="1">

<p>In 2013, the population of Harrisburg was 4,779. In 2023, 9,416. We estimate that by 2033 the population of Harrisburg will increase to 18,309. We anticipate net increases of 2,662 residents under the age of 25, 3,799 residents between the ages of 25-44, 1,922 residents between the ages of 45-64, and 510 residents 65 and older.</p>
<p>Communities in the Sioux Falls metro area have generally seen their populations increase over the past ten years. This chart shows how growth in Harrisburg compares to other communities that surround Sioux Falls. Note, these numbers are based on 5-year American Community Survey samples which allow for better comparisons for surrounding communities, but do not reflect the adjustments and additional data incorporated into the rest of the report to better project Harrisburg’s population.</p>

<p>While in 2013, Harrisburg was fairly closely clustered to the populations of other communities in the Sioux Falls metro area, by 2023 Harrisburg and Tea had broken off into their own cluster at higher populations.</p>

<p>Looking at the actual number of new residents per year, the relationship between proximity to Sioux Falls and net population increase is evident. Harrisburg is closest to Sioux Falls and sees the largest number of new residents annually.</p>
<p>While Harrisburg’s growth is the highest in the region as a percentage of its population, when considering the actual number of new residents per year, Harrisburg’s growth is only a fraction of the new residents Sioux Falls welcomes each year.</p>

<p>Harrisburg’s growth is downstream of growth in Sioux Falls, so it seems reasonable to assume that, at least from a demand perspective, Harrisburg could continue to sustain quite high levels of growth compared to its population for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Because multiple people often live in one household, we also look to household level data, by age.

<p>We expect the number of households in Harrisburg in 2033 to more than double compared to 2023, with the largest increase coming in households aged 25-44. For 2033, we project 461 households under the age of 25, 3,757 households aged 25-44, 2,279 households aged 45-64, and 484 households aged 65 and older.</p>

<p>In Harrisburg, for rental households with a household income below $75,000, there are more households at each income level than there are units affordable at that income level (424 households compared to 414 affordable units). This problem becomes particularly pronounced for households with an income below $50,000, with 277 households competing for 147 units affordable at that income level.</p>
<p>This is borne out in the American Community Survey’s affordability data, which shows that all rental households with an income above $75,000 are paying an affordable amount for rent, some rental households making $50,000-$74,999 are cost-burdened (meaning they pay more than 30% of their income in rent), most rental households making $35,000-$49,999 are cost-burdened, and all households making less than $34,999 are severely cost-burdened (meaning they pay more than 50% of their income in rent).</p>
<p>As Harrisburg attracts additional rental housing opportunities, filling these affordability gaps is critical.</p>

<p>In Harrisburg, there are generally more owner-occupied homes affordable at a particular income level than there are households at that income level. For example, there are 1,918 households with an income of at least $100,000 in Harrisburg living in owner-occupied housing units and there are 2,316 homes in Harrisburg that are affordable at that income level.</p>
<p>However, for households making less than $50,000 annually, there are fewer owner-occupied units than there are owner-occupied households. This is a relatively small group, with 289 owner-occupied households making less than $50,000 with access to only 151 housing units affordable at that income level, but these households are feeling the pressure of rising housing costs the most.</p>
<p>In fact, examining the American Community Survey’s affordability data, some owner-occupied households at every income level are cost-burdened, including those with a household income of $75,000 or more. These households are stretching beyond their means to afford a house in Harrisburg.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, all owner-occupied households with a mortgage in Harrisburg with an income below $50,000 are cost burdened.</p>

<p>In total, there are 1,954 workers that live outside of Harrisburg but commute into the community for work. The US Census classifies these as “inflow” workers, and they comprise 84% of people who are employed in Harrisburg.</p>
<p>The other 371 people (16%) who are employed in Harrisburg live and work in Harrisburg. The US Census classifies these as “internal” workers.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are 3,816 people who live in Harrisburg but leave to another community for work, meaning that 91% of workers who live in Harrisburg are employed outside the community. The US Census classifies these as “outflow” workers.</p>
<p>Net, 1,862 more people commute out of Harrisburg for work than commute into the community for work.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ii.-location-quotient-and-shift-share-analysis">ii. Location Quotient and Shift Share Analysis</h3>
<p>To understand the economic trends in Harrisburg, PorchLight conducted an economic analysis of major industries, comparing Harrisburg to the United States as a whole and looking at changes over a ten-year period.</p>
<p>First, PorchLight analyzed the Location Quotient for each category of industry in Harrisburg. Location Quotient compares the prevalence of a particular industry in Harrisburg compared to the nation. A location quotient higher than one (1) means an industry is more prevalent proportionally in the local area compared to the national average, and a location quotient below one (1) means the industry is less prevalent proportionally compared to the national average.</p>
<p>The following chart demonstrates how the Location Quotient of each industry in Harrisburg changed from 2013 to 2023. For example, in 2013, “Educational services, and health care and social assistance” in Harrisburg was about 1.32 times as prevalent compared to the national average, whereas by 2023 that had increased to 1.44 times the national average.</p>
<iframe title="Change in Location Quotient" aria-label="Arrow Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-NcpTJ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NcpTJ/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="854" height="420" data-external="1"></iframe>
<p>Additionally, PorchLight conducted a shift-share analysis of industries in Harrisburg to provide more detail on why some industries have more or fewer jobs than a decade ago. The shift-share analysis considers three things that affect changes in jobs: the effect of national job growth, the effect of industry mix, and the local share effect.</p>
<p>National growth looks at the overall 10-year job growth rate across all industries. For 2013-2023, that was 13%, so we assume, all else being equal, 13% of job growth in each industry is not specific to any industry.</p>
<p>Industry mix looks at each industry on a national level, assuming that local industry in Harrisburg is affected by similar forces that affect their industry across the country. This varies by industry.</p>
<p>After accounting for national growth and industry mix, we look at the local share effect. This is what is happening locally that is not explained by national growth or overall industry mix.</p>
<iframe title="Harrisburg, SD Shift-Share Analysis" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-uVzYo" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/uVzYo/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="782" height="916" data-external="1"></iframe>
<p>Across all industries, we calculate the following shift-share totals.</p>
<p>National Growth Effect: 335</p>
<p>Industry Mix Effect: 2</p>
<p>Local Share Effect: 1,742</p>
<p>= <strong>Total Local Employment Change 2,079</strong></p>
<p>Harrisburg’s job growth was primarily driven by local growth effects, particularly in education, but with strong growth across many industries.</p>

<section id="g.-vacancy-rates" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="g.-vacancy-rates">G. Vacancy Rates</h2>
<p>According to the American Community Survey, in 2023, 195 housing units in Harrisburg were vacant. However, none of those units were available for rent or for sale, with 49 being rented, but not occupied, 16 for seasonal, recreational, or occasional use, and 130 listed as “other vacant,” indicating they are not available for someone to move into. (B25004)</p>
<p>With no houses for sale or rent in Harrisburg, US Census data would indicate a 0% vacancy rate. However, PorchLight’s visual inspection (conducted in 2025) identified 68 houses for sale out of 2,282 single family housing units (including those under construction), indicating a vacancy rate of 2.98%. For owner-occupied units, we recommend a target vacancy rate of around 2%. Harrisburg’s vacancy rate is slightly higher than that 2% target, but this is not a concern because Harrisburg is growing quickly and those houses will quickly come off the market.</p>
<iframe title="Vacancy Targets: Harrisburg, SD" aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-0PSQj" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/0PSQj/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="209" data-external="1"></iframe>
<p>A 2% vacancy rate for owner-occupied housing demonstrates some availability in the market without a significant number of vacant properties. The typical American homeowner spends <a href="https://www.thezebra.com/resources/home/average-length-of-homeownership">about 13 years</a> in their home, and <a href="https://www.quickenloans.com/learn/timeline-for-selling-a-house">up to 90 days</a> on the market is considered an appropriate amount of time for a home to sell. Taking these factors into account, a home following a typical homeownership cycle will spend about 2% of time vacant. This indicates appropriate housing availability without long-term vacant housing.</p>
<p>For renter-occupied units, we recommend a target vacancy rate of 5-8%. Rental units experience higher turnover and provide necessary slack in the housing market. A 5-8% vacancy rate indicates the average rental unit spends one month vacant every 12-20 months.</p>

<section id="h.-building-permits" class="level2">

<p>The average construction cost for single-family structures increased from $243,000 to $397,000, though the median cost increased by a smaller amount, $228,000 to $317,000. The average and median costs both increased significantly, but the divergence between average and median home costs indicate that the top end of the market is seeing more activity in recent years, diverging significantly from the typical home construction cost in Harrisburg.</p>
<p>Additionally, Harrisburg saw the construction costs for multi-family units decrease. The average multi-family unit construction cost decreased from $150,000 in 2021 to $125,000 in 2024 and the median construction cost decreased from $148,000 in 2021 to $105,000 in 2024.</p>

<section id="i.-rapid-growth-and-infrastructure-needs" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="i.-rapid-growth-and-infrastructure-needs">i. Rapid Growth and Infrastructure Needs</h3>
<p>Harrisburg is currently experiencing unprecedented and sustained population growth, dramatically expanding from, as one interviewee put it, “1,800 people when we first moved here to now like 11,300” in approximately 20 years. This rapid expansion is projected to continue, with some suggesting the city could reach 25,000 people in the next 10-15 years, potentially making it “bigger than Aberdeen”.</p>
<p>The population influx is primarily driven by its proximity to Sioux Falls, the strong reputation of the Harrisburg School District, and a desire among residents for “the amenities of Sioux Falls and the small town feel.” This accelerated expansion is so profound that it has been described as a “time bomb of reality” that many outside Harrisburg have yet to fully comprehend, as the city quickly approaches and will soon surpass other major South Dakota communities in size.</p>
<p>This growth, averaging “400 or 500 people a year,” places significant strain on infrastructure, particularly its transportation network and water supply. While the sewer system is “set up well for growth,” the city faces challenges in funding and extending these utilities to new developments, leading to “not ideal and orderly, customary city growth and planning.” Road infrastructure is a major concern, with “major road construction” projects potentially costing “more than our annual city budget for everything that we do.” Meeting water supply needs requires Harrisburg to supplement its supply by purchasing water from Lincoln County rural water and Sibley, Iowa, but the general sense is that Harrisburg will be able to keep up with water infrastructure needs with proactive planning.</p>
</section>
<section id="ii.-affordability-and-availability" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ii.-affordability-and-availability">ii. Affordability and Availability</h3>
<p>Harrisburg is facing some challenges in housing affordability and availability, particularly for entry-level buyers and certain demographic groups, despite a high volume of new construction. There is a “lack of either older properties that a younger individual or first-time home buyer can buy, or a typical market entry-level home.” The median house price in Harrisburg has “grown like $80,000,” making it difficult for many to afford a home, with one speaker noting, “I struggle to see how a first time home buyer is going to be able to afford a $300,000 plus house.” This issue is compounded by high construction costs, particularly “with inflation and what we’ve seen happen in the last four to four and a half years.” As a result, there are “only a handful of homes that are under $200,000 in Harrisburg, or even under $250,000.” This gap in affordable ownership options means that while availability for rentals is “okay” and some newer apartment complexes are “not completely full,” there’s a concern about losing residents who “move out of their apartment to move to whatever community that they’re going to move to to find that starter home”.</p>
<p>The current housing stock also presents availability gaps for demographic needs across the age spectrum. While Harrisburg has seen an expansion of housing for the “older generation” like villas or small lot offerings to attract seniors, and the senior population in Harrisburg is notably increasing, there’s an acknowledged need for more units catering to specific needs such as multi-bedroom rentals for families and accessible units with features like “walk-in showers” and “ground floor units” for seniors.</p>
<p>The city’s predominantly new housing stock, while generally of good quality, lacks the older, typically more affordable properties often utilized by first-time home buyers. This situation also impacts the school district’s workforce, as new teachers and hourly staff may find it challenging to afford housing in Harrisburg, leading to situations where individuals might be “house poor” if they choose to live in Harrisburg. The community also needs housing options for those in service industries to support growing retail and commercial sectors, as lower-income workers can require shorter commutes.</p>
<p>The city’s growth trajectory and the nature of its development make these challenges persistent. Harrisburg’s average household income is relatively high, and there are “not as many very low-income families” in the community due to these affordability barriers. Some interviewees seek “equity opportunities” to allow residents to transition from rentals to homeownership. Additionally, landlords are looking to achieve a rental vacancy rate of “5% we think is healthy,” as zero vacancy is seen as detrimental to growth because there’s “no room for new growth.” There is a need for a balanced mix of housing types that can cater to all income levels and life stages, fostering a truly inclusive community.</p>
</section>
<section id="iii.-relationship-to-sioux-falls" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="iii.-relationship-to-sioux-falls">iii. Relationship to Sioux Falls</h3>
<p>Harrisburg’s explosive growth is linked to its close proximity to Sioux Falls, a dynamic that profoundly shapes its development. This relationship is so strong that the physical boundary between the two cities is rapidly becoming “seamless,” with new developments reaching the point where “Harrisburg and Sioux Falls developments are actually going to touch.” Initially, the population draw to Harrisburg was heavily influenced by the Harrisburg School District, which extends into parts of Sioux Falls, fostering a strong connection where even residents with a “Sioux Falls address, they feel very attached to the community there.”</p>
<p>This regional interdependence is further solidified by collaborative efforts through the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO), where both cities engage in regional transportation planning and have developed shared growth area boundaries. This coordinated approach acknowledges that the benefits and headaches related to infrastructure investments are shared, recognizing that public opinion “doesn’t care whose road it is. They just care that there’s a problem.”</p>
<p>While Harrisburg’s proximity to Sioux Falls has been a “blessing” from a housing perspective, fueling residential growth, it has simultaneously acted as a “hindrance” for Harrisburg’s sales tax and business development. Many Harrisburg residents commute to “work in Sioux Falls, come in and shop Sioux Falls, or just, you know, play on the greenway,” making it challenging for Harrisburg to generate sufficient local sales tax revenue to keep pace with its rapid residential expansion. This concern is a “live conversation” for the city, which is actively seeking to attract more businesses to encourage people to “work and live in town and and spend their money in town.” Harrisburg aims to evolve beyond being merely a “bedroom community” or “suburb of Sioux Falls,” striving to cultivate its own distinct identity by adding amenities and diverse local businesses. However, attracting establishments like restaurants is tough when “competing with the diversity of the restaurants in downtown Sioux Falls,” highlighting the ongoing challenge of fostering local commerce in the shadow of a larger, more established urban center.</p>
</section>
<section id="iv.-evolving-community-identity-and-amenities" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="iv.-evolving-community-identity-and-amenities">iv. Evolving Community Identity and Amenities</h3>
<p>Harrisburg is undergoing a significant transformation, grappling with the challenge of maintaining its established community identity amidst rapid and sustained population growth. Residents who moved to Harrisburg often did so for its “small town feel,” a quality many would “like to see… stay.” However, the city’s rapid expansion makes this increasingly difficult. The Harrisburg School District remains a powerful anchor for the community, fostering a strong sense of attachment even among those with a Sioux Falls address. This growth is so profound that one observer describes it as a “time bomb of reality” that many outside Harrisburg have yet to fully comprehend, with projections suggesting the city could become “bigger than Aberdeen” and surpass communities like Watertown in size. The city is actively striving to evolve beyond being merely a “bedroom community,” aiming to cultivate its “own distinct identity” by adding amenities and diverse local businesses.</p>
<p>This ambition is directly tied to the need for enhanced amenities and services. While Harrisburg has seen an increase in basic amenities, including two grocery stores, an Ace Hardware, and two health clinics, there are acknowledged “amenity shortfalls.” Attracting more diverse restaurants remains a challenge due to intense competition from “the diversity of restaurants in downtown Sioux Falls.” The city is actively working to attract more businesses to encourage people to “work and live in town and spend their money in town,” viewing sales tax revenue as “crucial” for supporting development. This transition is expected to lead to Harrisburg “seeing the fruit of that labor” as it gains more businesses like “Scooters, McDonald’s, and a new Japanese restaurant,” enabling residents to “reap the benefits of that growth” and enhance their quality of life.</p>

<section id="v.-strategic-planning-to-manage-growth-and-overcome-funding-challenges" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="v.-strategic-planning-to-manage-growth-and-overcome-funding-challenges">v. Strategic Planning to Manage Growth and Overcome Funding Challenges</h3>
<p>Harrisburg is actively engaged in strategic efforts to manage its growth, though it faces substantial infrastructure and funding challenges. The city’s rapid expansion is “being driven by the accessibility of utilities and the schools.” However, this growth is often “spread way out, with a whole bunch of gaps in between that we have to fill in, which is not ideal and orderly, customary city growth and planning.” Significant infrastructure needs, particularly for roads, require massive investment; for example, one mile of road improvement could be “more than our annual city budget for everything that we do.” A planned sewer trunk line extension was recently put on hold due to already high sewer fees. The city also grapples with water challenges, as its “original allotment [from Lewis and Clark] is significantly less than what it should have been,” though agreements to purchase water from other sources have covered current needs, and future growth should be manageable. Harrisburg works closely with the Sioux Falls Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) on regional transportation planning, which helps coordinate infrastructure projects and set shared growth area boundaries.</p>
<p>A major hurdle in funding this growth stems from legislative changes impacting property tax revenues. Recent legislation, such as Senate Bill 216, aims to “reduce the growth in the assessed value of owner-occupied property” and “limit increases in certain property tax revenues,” with caps as low as “three percent” annually for certain assessed values and school district levies. This is seen as “counterintuitive” by some, as lowering property taxes could “create more appeal for people wanting to come here because of lower property taxes,” potentially accelerating growth while pinching the city’s ability to fund essential services. As one speaker noted, Harrisburg worries about a future where it won’t have the revenue for operational needs like hiring more water or street operators or buying snowplows. To counteract this, Harrisburg relies heavily on sales tax revenue, which is considered “crucial.” The city is actively working to attract more businesses to encourage residents to “work and live in town and spend their money in town,” hiring a “marketing firm two years ago to help work on that.” This is vital because Harrisburg’s retail sales tax revenue currently lags behind comparable communities, like Brandon, despite a similar population size. While property taxes are a significant component, sales tax makes up “the brunt of [the city’s] revenue.” The city is also exploring a special census to increase state transportation funds for roadway work. The ambition is for Harrisburg to evolve beyond being merely a “bedroom community” or “suburb of Sioux Falls.” The city needs to “reap the benefits of growth” through increased sales tax revenues. While challenges persist, Harrisburg is proactively addressing them, with the school district notably recognized as “a leader and a model in how to stay at pace with their growth,” having a “very nice strategic plan for solutions moving forward, [including] land that’s been purchased.”</p>

<section id="vi.-maintaining-housing-stock-quality" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="vi.-maintaining-housing-stock-quality">vi. Maintaining Housing Stock Quality</h3>
<p>Harrisburg’s housing stock is primarily characterized by its newness and resulting high quality. The current housing units are “in really good shape because it’s all so new.” This prevalence of new construction is so pronounced that a home built in “2004 would probably be old” in comparison to the newer stock. Even the older properties are still considered to be “in pretty good shape” overall. This widespread newness ensures that the city currently faces minimal immediate concerns regarding the structural integrity or quality of its homes. Despite the current high quality, there are discussions around future maintenance and proactive code enforcement to sustain this standard. The city currently handles code enforcement “on a complaint basis.” However, there has been “a topic of discussion… on how to be more proactive around that.” Observations have been made, even in “some of the newer neighborhoods, [of] properties that… the yards aren’t taken care of.” While these properties are currently “in great shape,” there is a recognition that maintaining this quality will require ongoing attention and effort.</p>

<section id="i.-population-modeling" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="i.-population-modeling">i. Population Modeling</h3>
<p>PorchLight uses the following methodology to estimate population growth. To understand how this analysis works, it is easiest to consider a specific age group. For example, consider the cohort born in or after 1998, who will be aged 35-44 in 2033. Hover over “1998: 35-44” in the chart’s key to see this cohort highlighted. In 2013, this cohort was aged 15-24 and there were 431 of them in Harrisburg. Ten years later, this cohort was aged 25-34 and numbered 1,975. To estimate the size of this cohort in 2033, we look at the 1988 cohort, which increased by 46.2% when aging from ages 25-34 to 35-44, and assume the 1998 cohort will follow a similar in-migration pattern as they go through that same age transition. Some age groups will see increases and some will see decreases, and this modeling process helps us understand those age-specific changes based on the demographic push and pull factors of Harrisburg. In the case of the 1998 cohort, we project that in 2033, as they reach the ages of 34-44, there will be 2,890 of them.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ii.-tapestry-based-housing-structure-preference-modeling">ii. Tapestry-Based Housing Structure Preference Modeling</h3>
<p>Our Tapestry-Based Housing Structure Preference Modeling estimates the likely demand for different housing structure types — single-family homes, multi-family units, and mobile homes — based on the demographic composition and housing tenure of Harrisburg households. The methodology draws from the American Community Survey (ACS) Table B25125: Tenure by Age of Householder by Units in Structure, which provides a detailed cross-tabulation of housing occupancy by tenure, age of householder, and structure type.</p>
<p>The model begins with a breakdown of housing units in Harrisburg by owner-occupied versus renter-occupied tenure and by three age brackets: 15–34 years, 35–64 years, and 65 years and older. Within each segment, housing units are further categorized by structure type (e.g., single-family detached or attached, small multi-family buildings, large multi-family buildings, mobile homes, and other units).</p>
<p>To infer household preferences by demographic segment, the model compares Harrisburg’s current housing distribution to that of peer counties across South Dakota with similar Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC). These rural peer benchmarks are used to estimate the structure types typically occupied by households of similar age and tenure in comparable settings.</p>
<p>This comparative analysis yields an implied “tapestry” of preferred housing structures by demographic segment. The model then blends that expected demand based on rurality and age categories with the current housing type mix in Harrisburg to account for local preferences.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="iii.-limitation-of-census-data-in-rural-communities">iii. Limitation of Census Data in Rural Communities</h3>
<p>The United States Census American Community Survey (ACS) provides critical, granular data related to housing and population for rural communities. At the same time, this data is imperfect. Year-by-year data is based on sampling over a 5-year period, and margins of error are high in rural communities. Reproducing or finding this level of data would be nearly impossible without the American Community Survey, so its limitations are worth it for the data it can provide.</p>
<p>PorchLight works to collect additional data in the communities we work, including through community interviews, to ensure this data aligns with the reality on the ground.</p>
